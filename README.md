# Desktop-app
A desktop application built with Kotlin, integrated with a MySQL database.

This project was created with the intention of learning the basics and advanced technologies of the Kotlin programming language. I've implemented a user interface using Jetpack Compose, and established a connection to a MySQL database. Furthermore, I've written DAO models to enable read, write, update, and delete operations within the database.
